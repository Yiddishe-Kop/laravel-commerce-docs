After searching for a simple ecommerce package for Laravel and not finding a lightweight simple to use solution - I decided to attempt to create one myself.

[Laravel Commerce](https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-commerce) is an ecommerce package for Laravel with a simple and expressive API.

## Features

We plan to add all the following features:

<list :items="featuresDone" icon="IconCheckCircle"></list>
<list :items="featuresTodo" icon="IconInformationCircle"></list>

This package only implements the backend logic, and leaves you with full control over the frontend.
